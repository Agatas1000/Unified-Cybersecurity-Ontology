The Unified Cybersecurity Ontology (UCO) is intended to support information integration and cyber situational awareness in cybersecurity systems. The ontology incorporates and integrates heterogeneous data and knowledge schemas from different cybersecurity systems and most commonly used cybersecurity standards for information sharing and exchange. The UCO ontology has also been mapped to a number of existing cybersecurity ontologies as well as concepts in the Linked Open Data cloud. Similar to DBpedia which serves as the core for general knowledge in Linked Open Data cloud, we envision UCO to serve as the core for cybersecurity domain, which would evolve and grow with the passage of time with additional cybersecurity data sets as they become available.

If you use UCO or want to refer to it in a paper, please cite:

Current versions of the UCO family of ontologies are stored in this repository.  We recommend using the following URIs to refer to the ontologoes,  This will redirect to the current current versions and will be maintained for the forseeable future.
